# Beauvoir's demos
## [Empty](./empty/)
An empty program that explain how to create an empty Beauvoir project.
It also shows how to link Beauvoir as a shared library to you own projects.

## [Scene](./scene/)
A simple game where you can move a player on the screen.
It shows the roots of Beauvoir's scene system. This is the same sample that I copy/pasted on the main README :3

## [Gestalt](./gestalt/)
A small debuging program that I use to test new formats (both images or 3d meshes)

## [Shaders](./shaders/)
Some of the shaders I use to try things, you'll find:
- [default_lit.glsl](./shaders/default_lit.glsl), made to render 3d models with texture and lighting
- [landscape.glsl](./shaders/landscape.glsl), the shader use to render Beauvoir's landscapes
- [texture_unlit.glsl](./shaders/texture_unlit.glsl), a shader that render images
